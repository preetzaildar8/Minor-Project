      <h4 className='container'>The purpose of this project is to make exchange of books between students easy, by removing 
        the middlemen and hassle of availability. Students can directly connect with each other for the 
        books. Students needs book to study their courses, but can help juniors, by selling or donating 
        to juniors. This will help us to help the environment be saving the paper and hence the trees. 
        The lazy community who dreads themselves to take an initiative and sell their books or give 
        them to someone they just throw them in the bin. Now they will have a one click solution in 
        their hands. Sometimes a single library can't cater to this many students alone and hence there 
        is always a question of availability and the condition of fcfs2. Some students like to have a 
        book of their own which they can use freely and which they can't get from an issued book.<br />Hence, this project is a feasible and a rationale one in our opinion which will help people to 
        make their lives easy and furthermore protect the environment.</h4>
